After compiling and running remove3 I noticed that too many streets in the city are improperly labeled. 
For example Lagoon in Uptown is not a living_street, yet it is labeled as such. 
A classic living street is Nicollet Mall, this was one of the first to be invented in the USA

Furthermore, most of the sidewalks and such are removed in this variant of the program (which is good)

The lake roads are not fully removed.

Too many cross roads are included in the analysis.

Getting close, previous iteration was more accurate.
Learned that if `highway IS NOT NULL` is prefered to list of street types since most streets are not categorized correctly.
To get rid of a lot of bike trails and sidewalks I can use `name IS NOT NULL` to select only the good streets
